R E A S O N S


In the environment of control digital systems based on the uniqueness of file names, there is a need:
1. for eliminating the possibility of appearing of photo files with the same names, because in these cases there is a threat of loss of them due to overwriting;
2. for eliminating of incompatibility of naming systems of individual subsets of file representation of photos, because in these cases the convenience and productivity of shared use and maintenance of them is reduced.


D I R E C T I O N  O F  T H E  S O L U T I O N

Creating a unified naming system of file representation of photos, which completely or sufficiently eliminates the occurrence of files of the same name.


R E Q U I R E M E N T S  F O R  T H E  S O L U T I O N


The solution should strive for the most possible freedom for the conditions of creation, use and maintenance of file representation of photos.

GENERAL PROVISIONS


• The system is based on chronology and use of values of specific metadata for naming.
• The system is not strict and is only the basis, if necessary or if desired, digressions with preservation of the essence are permissible under user's personal responsibility
• Shooting conditions are assumed preferably within a single time zone on the Earth planet.
• Metadata values for naming are taken from original files of file representation of photos — raw files.
• All raw files must have at least sufficient for the system array of reliable original metadata.
• Software tool for realization of the system is ExifTool application by Phil Harvey.

• It is expected that user has at least a primary level of understanding of the ExifTool and Perl-compatible regular expressions.
• Because of the diversity of composition and content of metadata by different equipment manufacturers, the ExifTool commands proposed here reflects a particular case only, and it is assumed that, perhaps, there will be a need to adapt them with preservation of their essence to personal conditions and preferences.
• There must be an intermediate folder to collect raw files before ordering and using of them:

STORAGE_MEDIUM\INTERMEDIATE_FOLDER\

• The resulting structure of folders and files must be at the root of storage medium in order to more likely keep within length limit of full file name in different control digital systems; for example, the Windows provides a maximum of 260 characters for a full name.

• Only Latin, numbers and underscore are used:

a-Z, 0-9, _
